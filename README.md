# Web-Scrapping-Financial-Real-Time-Data

### This is a project to scrap data from the web and store the results in both a text file as well as the SQLite database.

### The program gets the list of Most Actives ticker symbols from the stocks website and uses it to create the stocks.txt and SQLite database.

### Verify that the StocksDatabase.db file is created and that the SQLite database contains the StocksTable with the appropriate columns and is populated with the data. 
### SQLite Browser may be used to verify database content.
